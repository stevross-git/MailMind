💡 Prompt for Replit AI Developer: Web-Based AI Email Organizer (Office 365)
Project Name: AI Email Organizer for Office 365

🔧 Project Overview
Build a web-based AI-powered email assistant that connects to a user's Office 365 mailbox via Microsoft Graph API. The app should:

Fetch, read, and analyze emails from the inbox.

Understand the context, urgency, and type of each email.

Organize or suggest actions (archive, label, reply, flag, forward).

Learn from the Sent Items to mimic the user’s writing tone and behavior.

Provide a clean chat-based interface for users to interact with the AI (ask questions like “What are my urgent emails?” or “Draft a reply to this email.”)

🔐 Assumptions
Azure AD application is already set up with correct Microsoft Graph API permissions (Mail.Read, Mail.Send, offline_access, User.Read, etc.)

OAuth 2.0 auth flow is handled or will be integrated in the backend.

User signs in with Microsoft account and grants access to mailbox.

🔍 Core Functionalities
🔄 Office 365 Integration
Use Microsoft Graph API to:

Authenticate users via OAuth

Fetch Inbox, Sent Items, custom folders

Send replies/emails from user account

🧠 AI Capabilities
Email Classification:

Identify email type: work, meeting, request, reminder, spam

Detect intent: follow-up, RSVP, complaint, opportunity, etc.

Suggested Actions:

Suggest replies (drafts), snooze, categorize, mark as important

Training on Sent Mail:

Analyze Sent Items to extract writing style, tone, common phrases

Fine-tune AI to write similar responses

Store this as a “Persona Embedding” or custom prompt template

📬 Smart Inbox Features
Flag urgent emails

Auto-label based on rules (e.g., from CEO = Priority)

Show summaries per thread

Conversation view with AI commentary

Ask: “Summarize today’s emails”, “What did I miss?”, “Prepare reply to this thread”

📊 Dashboard Features
Email breakdown by type, priority, sender

HTML/CSS + JS (or React)

Chat-style interface

Mailbox pane (side-by-side layout)

Backend
Python (Flask or FastAPI)

Microsoft Graph API integration

AI engine using OpenAI / Ollama / custom model

Vector DB (e.g., ChromaDB or FAISS) for memory of sent emails

Optional Redis for caching

🧠 AI Integration Notes
Email Understanding:

Use OpenAI/GPT-style models with few-shot or fine-tuned examples

Parse email body → detect sentiment, task, urgency

Learning From Sent Mail:

Tokenize + embed historical sent messages

Identify linguistic style (tone, structure, typical open/close)

Generate prompt templates from user tone

🔐 Security & Privacy
Store tokens securely (encrypted session or vault)

Only user-authorized access to their mailbox

No external sharing of email content

Optional local/offline mode for self-hosted privacy
